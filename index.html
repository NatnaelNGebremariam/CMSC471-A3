            <h2>White Hat</h2>
            <p>
                For the white hat visualization, we used a dataset that included greenhouse gas emissions from various countries around the world. We chose a box-and-whisker plot as our visualization because we believed it was the best way to emphasize changes in CO2 emissions across all countries in our dataset (i.e., more government regulation and scientific advancements lead to lower CO2 emissions). Using this type of visualization allows us to observe distributions, such as the average CO2 emissions, the lowest emissions, and the highest emissions within a given year. 
                This is particularly useful when comparing different years to see how countries have increased or decreased their CO2 emissions over time. We accomplish this by comparing the observed values across countries and years. When you hover over the data points, you can see the exact country and observed values. The visualization is designed to avoid misleading labels and skewed axes. All the countries from the dataset are included, and the y-axis starts at zero. Additionally, we filtered the data by two specific years to ensure that the same countries are represented in both years (for instance, some countries have data for 2014 but not for 2022). 
                This filtering helps avoid skewing the data and introducing bias.

        <h2>Black Hat</h2>
        <p>
            For the black hat visualization, we decided to use the data for COVID cases. We used various deceptive techniques, such as truncating the Y-axis, manipulating colors, filtering data, using misleading labels, and varying bar widths. The Y-axis starts at a value higher than zero, exaggerating the differences between bars. By doing this, we are able to make the difference between two counties seem bigger than they actually are. For example: 
            In 2019 Italy had about 6.97 cases, and France had 6.36; yet the graph makes it seem larger than it actually is. This compels the viewer to perceive the differences as much larger than they actually are. Since we are displaying the number of COVID-19 cases, the tallest bars are red to draw the viewer’s attention, reinforcing the idea that these cases were severe. The color red is often associated with danger and urgency, making the data appear more critical than it might actually be. 
            Meanwhile, the smaller bars are green, a color commonly linked to safety and positivity, subtly suggesting that these lower case numbers were within an acceptable range or not a cause for concern. Only specific years and countries were chosen to mislead the viewer into focusing solely on selected continents and how they were affected over time. Misleading labels were strategically used to reinforce the intended narrative and guide the viewer’s perception in a specific direction.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                Our group had 3 members. Two of the group members were in incharge of graphs, one for the white hat and the other for the black hat in Tableau, which took about <b>4-5 hours.</b>
                The other group member helped with doing the write-up on the webpage and recording the demo video, which took <b>2 hours.</b>  The part of the application that took the most time developing was for the Black Hat visualization. 
                Trying to find ways to make the data bias with misleading labels and axis was challenging at first, as it required deciding the type of graph and how to display the data. Once we made a visualization that had misleading axes and bias filtering, we still ended up with a major issue as the data came out 4 pages long. 
                It took a while, but we were able to limit the data to one page and use colors such as red to our advantage as a way to skew the viewer's perception.
